*Documentation for specific functions in this module will be automatically generated from the codebase.*

## Usage

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Access YOLOX functions
pxt.ext.functions.yolox.yolox(image, model_id='yolox_s', threshold=0.5)
```

## Features

This extension provides:
- Real-time object detection
- Multiple model sizes (nano, tiny, small, medium, large, x-large)
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Bounding box and classification outputs
- Integration with Pixeltable's Image data type

YOLOX is particularly well-suited for production computer vision applications requiring high accuracy and performance.
