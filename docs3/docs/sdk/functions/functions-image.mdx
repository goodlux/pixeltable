# Image

Image processing functions for resizing, format conversion, analysis, and transformations.

*Documentation for specific functions in this module will be automatically generated from the codebase.*

## Usage

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Access image processing functions
pxt.functions.image.resize(...)
pxt.functions.image.convert(...)
pxt.functions.image.rotate(...)
```

## Common Functions

This module typically includes functions for:
- Image resizing and scaling
- Format conversion (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Color space transformations
- Basic image analysis (dimensions, properties)
- Image transformations (rotate, flip, crop)

These functions work with Pixeltable's native Image data type and integrate seamlessly with other multimodal operations.
