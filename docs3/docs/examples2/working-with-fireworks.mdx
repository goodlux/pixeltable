# Working with Fireworks AI in Pixeltable

Pixeltable's Fireworks integration enables you to access LLMs hosted on
the Fireworks platform.

### Prerequisites

-   A Fireworks account with an API key (https://fireworks.ai/api-keys)

### Important Notes

-   Fireworks usage may incur costs based on your Fireworks plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you'll need to install required libraries and enter a Fireworks
API key.

Now let's create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.

    Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
    Created directory 'fireworks_demo'.





    <pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x301799de0>

## Completions

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Fireworks.

    Created table `chat`.
    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.





    UpdateStatus(num_rows="0", num_computed_values="0", num_excs="0", updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])



    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.





    UpdateStatus(num_rows="0", num_computed_values="0", num_excs="0", updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])



    Inserting rows into `chat`: 1 rows [00:00, 85.10 rows/s]
    Inserted 1 row with 0 errors.

<table border="1" className="dataframe">
<thead>
<tr style={{'text-align: right;'}}>

Massachusetts and is known for his role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and
his establishment of the Peace Corps.
