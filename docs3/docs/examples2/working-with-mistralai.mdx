# Working with Mistral AI in Pixeltable

Pixeltable's Mistral AI integration enables you to access Mistral's LLM
and other models via the Mistral AI API.

### Prerequisites

-   A Mistral AI account with an API key
    (https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/)

### Important Notes

-   Mistral AI usage may incur costs based on your Mistral AI plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you'll need to install required libraries and enter a Mistral AI
API key.

Now let's create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.

    Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
    Created directory `mistralai_demo`.





    <pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x3381254c0>

## Messages

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Mistral.

    Created table `chat`.
    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.


    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.

What three species of fish have the highest mercury content?
</td>
<td>

The three species of fish that typically have the highest mercury
content are:

1.  King Mackerel
2.  Shark
3.  Swordfish

These fish are often at the top of the food chain and consume other fish
that have accumulated mercury in their bodies. As a result, they tend to
have higher mercury levels. It\'s recommended to limit consumption of
these fish, especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers, young
children, and people who eat fish frequently.
