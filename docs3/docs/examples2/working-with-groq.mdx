# Working with Groq in Pixeltable

Pixeltable's Groq integration enables you to access Groq models via the
Groq API.

### Prerequisites

-   A Groq account with an API key
    (https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart)

### Important Notes

-   Groq usage may incur costs based on your Groq plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you'll need to install required libraries and enter your OpenAI
API key.

Now let's create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.

    Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
    Created directory 'groq_demo'.





    <pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x30bb80b20>

## Chat Completions

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Groq.

    Created table `chat`.
    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.





    UpdateStatus(num_rows="0", num_computed_values="0", num_excs="0", updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])



    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.





    UpdateStatus(num_rows="0", num_computed_values="0", num_excs="0", updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])



    Inserting rows into `chat`: 1 rows [00:00, 76.95 rows/s]
    Inserted 1 row with 0 errors.

How many islands are in the Aleutian island chain?
</td>
<td>

The Aleutian Island chain is a part of Alaska, United States, and it
stretches for approximately 1,200 miles (1,950 km) westward from the
Alaska Peninsula toward Japan. The chain consists of more than 300
islands, with the largest island being Unimak Island.

According to the Alaska Geographic Society, there are 314 islands in the
Aleutian Island chain, although the exact number can vary depending on
how the islands are defined and counted. Some sources may group certain
islands together or recognize smaller islands that others do not.

The Aleutian Islands are a remote and rugged chain, with many of the
islands being uninhabited. The islands are volcanic in origin, and they
are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including sea otters, puffins,
and brown bears.
