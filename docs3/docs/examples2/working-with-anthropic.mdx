# Working with Anthropic in Pixeltable

Pixeltable's Anthropic integration enables you to access Anthropic's
Claude LLM via the Anthropic API.

### Prerequisites

-   An Anthropic account with an API key
    (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started)

### Important Notes

-   Anthropic usage may incur costs based on your Anthropic plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you'll need to install required libraries and enter an Anthropic
API key.

Now let's create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.

    Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
    Created directory `anthropic_demo`.





    <pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x33944b3a0>

## Messages

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Anthropic.

    Created table `chat`.
    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.


    Added 0 column values with 0 errors.

What was the outcome of the 1904 US Presidential election?
</td>
<td>

The outcome of the 1904 US presidential election was:

-   The Republican candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, won the election.
    Roosevelt had become president in 1901 after the assassination of
    President William McKinley, and this was his first election as the
    Republican nominee.

-   Roosevelt defeated the Democratic candidate, Alton B. Parker, by a
    wide margin, winning 56.4% of the popular vote and 336 electoral
    votes compared to Parker\'s 37.6% of the popular vote and 140
    electoral votes.

-   Roosev ...... cies and his aggressive foreign policy, known as \"Big
    Stick\" diplomacy.

-   The election was also notable for the fact that it was the first
    time a sitting president (Roosevelt) was elected in his own right
    after originally assuming the presidency due to the death of his
    predecessor.

So in summary, Theodore Roosevelt won a decisive victory over Alton B.
Parker, cementing his status as a powerful and popular president during
the Progressive Era of American politics in the early 20th century.
