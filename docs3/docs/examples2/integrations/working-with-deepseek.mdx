<td>What was the outcome of the 1904 US Presidential election?</td>
<td>The **1904 U.S. Presidential election** resulted in a decisive victory for the incumbent **Republican** President **Theodore Roosevelt**, who had assumed office in 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley. ### **Key Results:** - **Theodore Roosevelt (Republican)** won **56.4%** of the popular vote and **336 electoral votes** (70.6% of the total). - **Alton B. Parker (Democrat)** received **37.6%** of the popular vote and **140 electoral votes**. - **Eugene V. Debs (Socialist)** and **Silas C. Swallow (Prohibition)** also ran but received minimal support. ### **Significance:** - Roosevelt's landslide victory solidified his leadership and progressive policies, including trust-busting and conservation efforts. - This was the first election in which a sitting president who had inherited the office (rather than being elected to it) won a full term in his own right. Roosevelt carried **32 of the 45 states**, demonstrating broad national support.</td>

# Working with Deepseek in Pixeltable

Pixeltable’s Deepseek integration enables you to access Deepseek’s LLM
via the Deepseek API.

### Prerequisites

-   A Deepseek account with an API key (https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)

### Important Notes

-   Deepseek usage may incur costs based on your Deepseek plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you’ll need to install the required libraries and enter a Deepseek
API key. Deepseek uses the OpenAI SDK as its Python API, so we need to
install it in addition to Pixeltable.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable openai
```


```python
