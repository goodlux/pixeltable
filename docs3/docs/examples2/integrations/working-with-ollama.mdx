<td>What are the most popular services for LLM inference?</td>
<td>LLM (Large Language Model) inference is a complex process that involves generating human-like text using artificial intelligence models. The most popular services and technologies used in this field include: 1. **Hugging Face**: Hugging Face, an open-source platform, provides several APIs and libraries for building LLMs. Some of the most commonly used ones are: - `transformers` (for natural language processing) - `torchtext` (for text generation) - `t5` (for T5 models) - `pytorc ...... based on user input. These services are popular because they provide flexibility, speed, and ease of use for developers who want to work with large language models. The choice of service depends on the specific requirements of your project, including the type of data you're working with, the level of customization you need, and whether you prefer a more lightweight or more powerful solution. If you have any questions about these services or if you need help choosing one, feel free to ask!</td>

# Working with Ollama in Pixeltable

Ollama is a popular platform for local serving of LLMs. In this
tutorial, we’ll show how to integrate Ollama models into a Pixeltable
workflow.

## Install Ollama

You’ll need to have an Ollama server instance to query. There are
several ways to do this.

### Running on a Local Machine

-   If you’re running this notebook on your own machine, running
    Windows, Mac OS, or Linux, you can install Ollama at:
    [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

### Running on Google Colab

-   OR, if you’re running on Colab, you can install Ollama by
    uncommenting and running the following code.


```python
# To install Ollama on colab, uncomment and run the following
# three lines (this will also work on a local Linux machine
# if you don't already have Ollama installed).

# !curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
# import subprocess
# ollama_process = subprocess.Popen(['ollama', 'serve'], stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```

### Running on a remote Ollama server

-   OR, if you have access to an Ollama server running remotely, you can
    uncomment and run the following line, replacing the default URL with
    the URL of your remote Ollama instance.


```python
# To run the notebook against an instance of Ollama running on a
# remote server, uncomment the following line and specify the URL.

# os.environs['OLLAMA_HOST'] = 'https://127.0.0.1:11434'
```

Once you’ve completed the installation, run the following commands to
verify that it’s been successfully installed. This may result in an LLM
being downloaded, so it may take some time.


```python
%pip install -qU ollama
```


```python
