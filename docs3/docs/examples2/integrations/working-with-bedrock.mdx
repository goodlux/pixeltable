# Working with Bedrock in Pixeltable

Pixeltable’s Bedrock integration enables you to access AWS Bedrock via
the Bedrock API.

### Prerequisites

-   Activate Bedrock in your AWS account.
-   Request access to your desired models (e.g. Claude Sonnet 3.7,
    Amazon Nova Pro)
-   Optional - you may need to configure AWS CLI locally to authenticate
    with your AWS account.

### Important Notes

-   Bedrock usage may incur costs based on your Bedrock plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you’ll need to install required libraries and enter an Bedrock API
key.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable boto3 duckduckgo-search
```


```python
