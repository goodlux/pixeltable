<td>What three species of fish have the highest mercury content?</td>
<td>The three species of fish that typically have the highest mercury content are: 1. King Mackerel 2. Shark 3. Swordfish These fish are often at the top of the food chain and consume other fish that have accumulated mercury in their bodies. As a result, they tend to have higher mercury levels. It's recommended to limit consumption of these fish, especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers, young children, and people who eat fish frequently.</td>

# Working with Mistral AI in Pixeltable

Pixeltable’s Mistral AI integration enables you to access Mistral’s LLM
and other models via the Mistral AI API.

### Prerequisites

-   A Mistral AI account with an API key
    (https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/)

### Important Notes

-   Mistral AI usage may incur costs based on your Mistral AI plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you’ll need to install required libraries and enter a Mistral AI
API key.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable mistralai
```


```python
