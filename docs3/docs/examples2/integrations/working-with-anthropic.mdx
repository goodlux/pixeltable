<td>What was the outcome of the 1904 US Presidential election?</td>
<td>The outcome of the 1904 US presidential election was: - The Republican candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, won the election. Roosevelt had become president in 1901 after the assassination of President William McKinley, and this was his first election as the Republican nominee. - Roosevelt defeated the Democratic candidate, Alton B. Parker, by a wide margin, winning 56.4% of the popular vote and 336 electoral votes compared to Parker's 37.6% of the popular vote and 140 electoral votes. - Roosev ...... cies and his aggressive foreign policy, known as "Big Stick" diplomacy. - The election was also notable for the fact that it was the first time a sitting president (Roosevelt) was elected in his own right after originally assuming the presidency due to the death of his predecessor. So in summary, Theodore Roosevelt won a decisive victory over Alton B. Parker, cementing his status as a powerful and popular president during the Progressive Era of American politics in the early 20th century.</td>
